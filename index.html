    <h1>Project on console</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is an IDE (integrated development environment). We have already used 2 other IDE's before. One was brackets and the other was code.io. To set this software up you first need to install it. </p>
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Use this link to download visual studio </a>
    <p>Now just follow the steps to install and open the software. Once you have done this, make a new folder on your desktop and then go back to visual studio. Now on the left you should be able to see some options. Click on the first one and then select open folder and select the folder you had created. Now on the left you should see a blank area. Right click in the area and create a new file. It should have .html at the end. Now in the file write the basic html code.</p>
    <p>The console is used to debug the errors in the code. But we can also use it to print numbers, strings and variables. To open the console right click on the page and select inspect. It should show you some options on the top. Now click on "console". It will show you the console</p>
    <P>To print anything on the console screen you have to write the script tags and inside that you have to write console.log("(ur message);") </P>
    <p>Now let's make 2 variables and join them together. Me and my friends had this game called Birth/Death in which one person says birth and the other says death. Suppose you had two variables. One has the string Birth and the other has Death. Now if we want to join these too we can just write "console.log("BirthDeath")" But we can make it more simple by making a variable and joining them using a js function called "concat()" I will give you an example right now. "var joined = var1.concat(var2);" also don't forget to console log this.</p>
    <p>Next I will show you how to do some math operations. Let's assume we created 2 variables that have the numbers 2 and 4 assigned to them now lets try getting the square root of the second one. To do this we have to write something like "var squareroot = Math.sqrt(eg2);" And then log it. Another function is power. Like "eg1" to the power of "eg2". To use this command you have to write "var poweranswer = Math.pow(eg1, eg2);" And don't. forget. to log it. Check console to see if it works.</p>
    <script> 
    console.log("Hi. This is the console screen.")

    var var1 = "Birth";

    var var2 = "Death";

    var joined = var1.concat(var2);

    console.log(joined);

    var eg1 = "2";

    var eg2 = "4";

    var squareroot = Math.sqrt(eg2);

    console.log(squareroot);

    var poweranswer = Math.pow(eg1, eg2);

    console.log(poweranswer);

    </script>
